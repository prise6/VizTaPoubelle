* Dynamic graphs


## My own challenge

* Create a web app
* Mobile responsive
* Few days project

_Learn these following techs:_

* Docker for environment
* Reactjs and flux for js
* Bulma for css
* Webpack for dev
* Leaflet + Chartist for dynamic graphs


## Results

* [FR] website : [dataquizz.com](http://dataquizz.com) 

Known issues : IE not fully supported.


## What i should have done better

* Mine more data
* Use more reactjs pattern i guess (hard for the first time)
* Learn more about Docker

## To Do

* Extend concept
* Try reactnative


## Directories

### `/Rprojet`

* Process data to json files

### `/App`

__Web app__

* `src`: web scripts
* `Docker`: docker to build/run dev or prod app 
* `dist`: website files

Well, the result still satisfies me :) !
Enjoy.
